function [newDT] = dtUpdate(dt,neighborSet,vertex1,vertex2,midpoint)
%% DESCRIPTION
% Takes the previous delaunay triangulation, the generated set of neighbors
% in the triangulation, the vertices to be removed, and their midpoint and
% outputs an updated delaunay triangulation with vertex1 and vertex2
% removed and replaced by their midpoint
%
% dt.X is the list of dt points



    return newDT
